Please assist me with beginning to develop an Android application.

I'd like to create a dashboard app intended to run continuously (ie, in "kiosk mode").

The purpose of this app is to monitor news developments in a geopolitically volatile region.

The app will provide a quadrant display (ie, the screen will be divided into four).

I'd like the following features.

## Top Left Quadrant

Live TV feed. By default this opens to this URL: https://www.kan.org.il/live/

But users have the ability to toggle to this URL: https://video.i24news.tv/live/brightcove/en

There are buttons for toggling between the two feeds with the labels Kan (for the first link) and i24 (for the second link)

# Top Right Quadrant

This quadrant will display an embed object showing a specific Google News version.

The URL is: https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-IL&gl=IL&ceid=IL:en

# Bottom left quadrant

This quadrant will embed and display this URL:

https://www.oref.org.il/eng/alerts-history

# Bottom right quadrant 

This quadrant will display a long list of buttons which are links. I will add them. But feel free to placeholder values.
